                <p style="font-family: serif;">
                    The first chapter of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, titled "The Boy Who Lived," opens with a glimpse into the ordinary world of the Dursleys, a seemingly typical family living in Little Whinging, Surrey. Mr. Vernon Dursley, a director at a drill-making company called Grunnings, is a large, rather gruff man with little patience for anything unusual, while his wife, Petunia, is a thin woman who prides herself on being proper and disapproves of anything out of the ordinary. Together with their son, Dudley, they live a life they consider normal and strive to avoid any strange occurrences.

One morning, as Mr. Dursley leaves for work, he notices a few peculiar things around him that disrupt his usual routine. He sees a cat reading a map and later notices the same cat staring intently at the Dursleys' house. This unnerves him, but he dismisses it as a figment of his imagination. As he drives through town, he sees people dressed in strange cloaks, seemingly celebrating something. He overhears snippets of conversation about someone named "Harry Potter," which unsettles him because he realizes that he may have heard that name before. However, he brushes it off and tries to continue his day, dismissing these unusual occurrences as coincidences.

Later that night, as the Dursleys sleep, an enigmatic figure named Albus Dumbledore arrives on Privet Drive. Dressed in long robes and with a long silver beard, Dumbledore exudes an air of wisdom and mystery. He is soon joined by a stern-looking woman named Professor Minerva McGonagall, who has been keeping a close watch on the Dursleys' house in her Animagus form, the tabby cat that Mr. Dursley had noticed earlier. They discuss the recent defeat of the dark wizard Voldemort, who had terrorized the wizarding world. Voldemort’s fall was unexpected and has led to widespread celebrations.

The conversation shifts to the reason they are there: the arrival of Harry Potter. Dumbledore reveals that Harry’s parents, James and Lily Potter, were killed by Voldemort, but when Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse rebounded, leaving the baby unharmed except for a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. This incident led to Voldemort’s mysterious disappearance, which the wizarding community is celebrating. However, Dumbledore has chosen to leave Harry with his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys, despite McGonagall's reservations about their suitability as guardians.

Soon after, a giant man on a flying motorcycle, Rubeus Hagrid, arrives with the infant Harry. Hagrid is visibly emotional about parting with Harry but trusts Dumbledore’s judgment. Dumbledore places a letter explaining Harry’s background with the baby, hoping that the Dursleys will care for him, despite McGonagall's concerns. After a final exchange, the three wizards leave, and Harry is left on the doorstep of Number 4, Privet Drive, setting the stage for his future as he unknowingly begins a journey into the magical world.

This chapter introduces readers to the divide between the magical and non-magical worlds and plants the first seeds of mystery and destiny surrounding Harry Potter, a boy who, though seemingly ordinary, is destined for extraordinary things.Later that night, the mysterious Albus Dumbledore arrives on Privet Drive, joined by Professor McGonagall and Hagrid, who delivers baby Harry on a flying motorcycle. Their discussion reveals that Harry’s parents were murdered by the dark wizard Voldemort, but Harry miraculously survived Voldemort's deadly curse. The scar on his forehead becomes an iconic symbol of his survival and the mysterious power that shielded him. Dumbledore, though a revered figure in the magical world, leaves Harry with the Dursleys, hoping they’ll provide him a safe, if mundane, upbringing away from the fame awaiting him.
